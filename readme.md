# Usage

Be sure to add support of [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/#download) into your code editor.

```bash
npm i             # to install dependencies
npm start         # to run development server (to stop: Ctrl+C)
npm run bemlint   # to check html files of build folder for compliance with BEM
npm run puglint   # to check pug files
npm run stylelint # to check scss files
```

Before committing, files are automatically checked. If the check revealed errors, they will be displayed in the terminal.
